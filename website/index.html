    <h1>SnF Schedule</h1>
    <p>Usable calendars for the Sun 'n Fun Aerospace Expo</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h4>What</h4>
    <p>Use these links to import the <a href="https://flysnf.org/event-activities/aviation-activities/#">Sun 'n Fun Aerospace Expo</a> schedule into calendar software of your choice. They've been tested with Google Calendar.</p>
    <p>Events are categorized into several files, so you can view just one at a time without so much clutter that it becomes difficult to use. Suggestions are welcome on the category choices.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Link</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Forums</td>
                <td><a href="/ical/2022/forums.ics">Link</a></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Workshops</td>
                <td><a href="/ical/2022/workshops.ics">Link</a></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Facilities (parking, tickets, merch, family zone, seating)</td>
                <td><a href="/ical/2022/facilities.ics">Link</a></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Other (everything else)</td>
                <td><a href="/ical/2022/other.ics">Link</a></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>Why</h4>
    <p>I have no connection to the expo. I'm just a first-time attendee in 2022 who wanted to look at the schedule, found the expo's <a href="https://dailyschedule.flysnf.org/">online schedule</a> to be unusable, and decided
to convert their data into <a href="https://icalendar.org/">iCalendar</a> files that could be imported into standard calendar software.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>How</h4>
    <p>Copy each link, and use it to import a calendar into your calendar software. For example, Google Calendar lets you create a new calendar from a URL. Scroll down to the "Use a link..." section in <a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">their documentation</a>.</p>

    <h4>No Guarantees</h4>
    <p>This data might be wrong. It's only as correct as what the expo published on their website. And while I don't think my conversion mangled the data, it might have.</p>
    <p>If an event is important to you, verify the time and location through a primary source.</p>

    <h4>Updates</h4>
    <p>I have no idea if, or how often, the source data changes on the SnF website. But for good measure, these iCalendar files are re-generated every hour.</p>
    <p>Note that software such as Google Calendar may not re-load the data from my links for several hours or longer.</p>
