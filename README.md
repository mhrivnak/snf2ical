# snf2ical

snf2ical is a tool that converts the raw event data from Sun 'n Fun into
iCalendar files that can be imported into calendar software.

The Sun 'n Fun online schedule is basically unusable due to how it's rendered in
a table that's incapable of sorting chronologically. Thus I found it useful to
write this tool that ingests the event data and creates ical files.
